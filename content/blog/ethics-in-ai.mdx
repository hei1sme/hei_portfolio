As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, considering its ethical implications is paramount.

### Key Areas

*   **Bias:** Ensuring AI models don't perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases found in data.
*   **Accountability:** Determining responsibility when AI systems make mistakes.
*   **Transparency:** Making AI decision-making processes understandable (Interpretability/Explainability).

Developing AI responsibly requires ongoing discussion and careful design choices.
