Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a central force of technological transformation, but entering this field as a newcomer can be both thrilling and intimidating. This blog is written from the lens of someone who has just started their journey – not an expert, but a student in awe of what lies ahead.

### Before You Learn AI – A Word of Advice

If you're considering diving into AI, take a moment to reflect. Ask yourself:

- Are you ready to learn continuously?
- Can you accept that AI is not magic, but a complex layering of mathematics, logic, data, and computing power?
- Are you prepared to sometimes not understand things immediately?

If yes, then welcome. You're in for a journey that's intellectually demanding but deeply rewarding.

I recommend getting familiar with the following **before** you commit deeply:

- **Python programming**: Core syntax, data structures, and libraries like NumPy or Pandas.
- **Linear algebra and basic calculus**: Essential for understanding how models learn.
- **Data literacy**: Learn to handle, clean, and understand data.
- **Mindset**: Stay curious, humble, and persistent. Your first impression of AI will change – several times.

### A Glimpse Back: What I Thought AI Was

When I first entered university, I believed I already knew what AI was. I thought of it as smart systems, automation, and ChatGPT-like tools. I felt confident, even proud, to be part of such a forward-looking field.

But that confidence quickly cracked.

University courses started simply enough. I learned about machine learning types, simple models like linear regression, and classification. But with every passing week, I realized:

> I was looking at an ocean and thought it was a pond.

New concepts emerged like layers in a neural network: gradient descent, loss functions, activation functions, backpropagation. I couldn't grasp it all at once. But instead of feeling discouraged, I was… intrigued.

### ChatGPT – My Wake-Up Call

The first time I used ChatGPT was a turning point. I asked it questions, and it replied with clarity. I asked it to write code – it did. I told it to analyze things – it responded almost like a human.

It amazed me.

How could a system understand what I wanted and respond with such depth? What allowed it to generate new content?

That pushed me to learn about large language models, transformers, tokenization, attention mechanisms. I didn't understand everything, but I started to see that **AI wasn't magic – it was layers of engineering and mathematics.**

### Excitement Turned into Overwhelm

The more I studied, the more I realized the sheer vastness of the AI field. Each concept branched into more questions:

- Neural networks led me to CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs
- Image generation took me to GANs
- Self-learning led to reinforcement learning

Each topic was its own field. I was fascinated, but also overwhelmed. I asked myself:

> Can I really catch up? Can I stay relevant in this fast-paced field?

That fear – the fear of falling behind – was real. But instead of paralyzing me, it became a motivator.

### The Silly Math Struggler Studying AI

Here's something you might find ironic – I struggle with math.

Algebra, calculus, probability… they all used to feel like foreign languages. Sometimes they still do. I was never the math prodigy. In fact, it felt like math and I were in an eternal battle.

So what am I doing here, in a field built on mathematics?

That’s a question I’ve asked myself more than once.

But strangely, the deeper I dive into AI, the more motivated I become to *actually understand* the math behind it. Not because I’m suddenly good at it, but because it unlocks the magic. Every equation I understand is like deciphering a piece of the AI puzzle.

Call me silly – a math struggler choosing AI. But maybe that’s exactly the kind of curiosity this field needs.

### I Once Wanted to "Fight AI"

Ironically, when I first chose AI, part of me wanted to "fight against it." I saw it as a disruptive force – one that could replace jobs, manipulate systems, even outsmart people.

But over time, I realized:

> AI is not inherently good or bad. It's a mirror of how we use it.

Instead of opposing it, I decided to **understand it, guide it, and maybe one day, shape it.**

### Final Thoughts: The Journey is the Goal

If you're just starting out like I am – don't worry if you feel overwhelmed. You're not alone. Everyone in this field, even the experts, are still learning.

What matters is:

- Start small, but start consistently.
- Ask questions, even basic ones.
- Accept that confusion is part of the process.
- Be amazed, but stay critical.

This is my first blog post, and perhaps years from now, I'll look back and smile at how little I knew. But for now, I'm proud to have started.

Because every great journey begins with the courage to say: **"I don't know – but I want to learn."**

Stay tuned for more insights from this beginner's perspective.
