Deep learning models can often feel like black boxes. Visualization techniques help us interpret their decisions.

### Techniques

*   **Activation Maps:** Show which parts of an input image activate specific filters in a CNN.
*   **Saliency Maps:** Highlight the input pixels most influential in the model's prediction.

Tools like TensorBoard can be invaluable for monitoring training and visualizing model graphs.
