Building my first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was an exciting journey into the world of deep learning. It involved understanding layers, activation functions, and the importance of good data.

### Challenges Faced

Data augmentation was crucial... Overfitting was initially an issue, requiring techniques like dropout and careful validation splitting. Choosing the right optimizer and learning rate also took experimentation.

```python
# Example code snippet
def build_model():
  # ... model layers ...
  # Convolutional Layer
  # Pooling Layer
  # Flatten Layer
  # Dense Layer
  return model
```

Overall, a fantastic learning experience! More details to come.
