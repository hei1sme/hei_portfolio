Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field bridging computer science and linguistics. This post covers some foundational concepts.

### Key Concepts

*   **Tokenization:** Splitting text into individual words or sentences (tokens).
*   **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form.
*   **TF-IDF:** Measuring the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

```python
# Pseudo-code for TF-IDF
def calculate_tf_idf(term, document, corpus):
  tf = term_frequency(term, document)
  idf = inverse_document_frequency(term, corpus)
  return tf * idf
```

These are just the building blocks for more complex NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation.
