## Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The main goals were:

*   To analyze factors contributing to employee turnover
*   To build an accurate prediction model
*   To provide actionable insights for HR departments
*   To create a user-friendly interface for predictions

## Key Features

*   **Data Analysis:** Comprehensive EDA of employee data
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Trained on historical data to predict attrition
*   **Feature Importance:** Identified key factors affecting employee retention
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Visual representation of predictions and insights

## Tech Stack Deep Dive

*   **Language:** Python
*   **ML Framework:** scikit-learn
*   **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy
*   **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
*   **Deployment:** Streamlit

## Challenges & Solutions

One challenge was handling imbalanced data in the attrition prediction. This was addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes.

Another challenge was feature selection and engineering to improve model accuracy. We used recursive feature elimination and domain knowledge to select the most relevant features.
