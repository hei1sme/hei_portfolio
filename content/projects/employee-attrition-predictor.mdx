## Overview

This project is the third major version of my personal portfolio website. The main goals were:

*   To create a modern, visually engaging platform showcasing my skills.
*   To leverage the latest features of Next.js (App Router).
*   To experiment with different animation libraries (Framer Motion & GSAP).
*   To ensure optimal performance and responsiveness.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Sections:** Utilizes scroll-driven animations (Experience timeline) and component entrance animations.
*   **MDX Blog & Projects:** Content managed through Markdown/MDX for ease of updating.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout adapting from mobile to large desktops using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Performance Optimized:** Leverages Next.js features like Server Components and static generation.

## Tech Stack Deep Dive

*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion (for component transitions), GSAP + ScrollTrigger (for complex scroll animations)
*   **Deployment:** Vercel

## Challenges & Solutions

One challenge was integrating GSAP's imperative API within React's declarative structure, especially managing cleanup in `useEffect`. This was addressed using `gsap.context()` for proper scoping and cleanup.

Another challenge was optimizing the different animation approaches to work smoothly together without performance degradation.
